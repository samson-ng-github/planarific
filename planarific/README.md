This is a coding challenge set by Planarific to implement a web UI which displays 3D models from the provided API.

Basic user stories include:

The user can view a list of models.
The user can select a particular model, in order to view its detailed metadata and view it in 3D.
The user can pan, tilt and zoom the 3D representation.
The user can reset the 3D representation by clicking on an icon.
The user can switch to a different model's 3D representation and metadata.

Extra user stories include

The user can click on a point on the model and view its 3D coordinates.
The position of the point is indicated by a small blue sphere.
The user can toggle between textured and wireframe representations by clicking on an icon.
The user can view the applications of both desktop and mobile, both with a different design.
Before the model loads, the user can see the progress in a circular loading bar.
There is a 3D background made with lamina library.

Design consideration:

Main font is League Spartan, in according with the Planarific website.
Colour pallette is orange, blue and black. The orange is Planarific brand colour. Blue is its complementary colour.
